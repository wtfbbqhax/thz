Looking for Tremulous 1.2 hacks? (https://github.com/ztdretcher/zt-tremulous)


## February 9, 2011 ##
ZIPTool, the tool used to purify PK3 files has been updated to version 2.0.0.

Find it @ http://ziptool.googlecode.com

Just to let everyone know, I will not be updating THZ for Tremulous 1.2.

Hopefully the legit players can feel some weight being lifted as my maintaining THZ accounts for probably (my guess) 50-90% of the cheaters.


the repository will stay up, notes to those interested in modifying it themselves for 1.2:
  * aimbot is broken in the repos, I have entirely no idea where its broken
  * 1/2 of the hacks in the repos are more about commenting out restrictions so be creative :)
  * write issues if you have questions about certain things, I do reply to them, generally within a week.


Thanks for downloading my stuff thousands of times, really an ego boost to see such large download numbers.


Also don't forget to check out my PK3 Purifier ziptool (http://code.google.com/p/ziptool/) its what makes it possible for THZ to be compatible on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX. Which I believe is a first for any quake hack. :)


Thanks!

Work + school sucks.
Expect an updated svn within the next few days.

Should contain
```
  - Enhanced trigger bot
  - Cleaned up Scanner/Radar code
  - Aim bot will probably be broken ( just use the old stuff )
  - Might include the blowfish alternate kill message.
```

If you want to take advantage of the new trigger bot you'll need to compile it yourself. I don't want to make another worthless build where aim bot doesn't work.

##### Hello, Caffeinated again, #####

School is going easier than expected which is allowing me much more free time than previously expected, some of which I will be appropriating to THZ. So in the next few days I will be fixing/Adding some things that have been bugging me. ( see the issues )
<br>

Hopefully a few people will be interested in QA'ing ( testing ) these releases to make sure nothing is broken.<br>
<br>

If you are interested then CC me at my google mail, and I will be getting back to you describing what I need.<br>
<br>

Thanks, <br>
Caffeinated.<br>

<h3>Hello, <i>Caffeinated</i> here,</h3>

This will be my <i>last</i> update for a while, Monday I will update the THZ Client + QVM's so that they work as expected, and PK3 QVM-set will be updated to the latest source code revision to reflect the minor additions I have added.<br>
<br><br>

<h3>Regarding issues</h3>

I will closing all open issues, and not be accepting any new ones.<br>
<br><br>

I do this because I have not / nor can I, address these issues in any acceptable way due to my inexperience in the Tremulous Source code.<br>
<br><br>

<h3>Everything else</h3>
While the Downloads won't be updated anytime soon, the source code will be receiving many updates, as well as the Wiki section.<br>
<br><br>

My regards and happy hacking, <br>
<i><b>Caffeinated</b></i>
