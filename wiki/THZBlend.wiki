= THZ Blend? =

While it is just a mock-name for now, I plan on starting on my branch of the THZ client. 

= Details =

I Plan on:
  * Revising the client up to a newer revision. Possibly HEAD.
  * Start on updating client qvm's preparing the code for trem1.2 ( if it comes out )
  * Various client side mods including several from FSM-Trem such as player cvars, as well as...
  * Math processing, perhaps WireDDD's.


What I do not plan on:
  * There will be no GUID haxxing.
  * No destructive hacks, such as overflows and malformed client packets.
