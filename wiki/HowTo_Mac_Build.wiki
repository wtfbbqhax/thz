==Intro==

As long as you have the necessary tools, building thz-mac client should be fairly straight 
forward.

===To begin:===

 # Grab the HEAD tremulous revision
 # Steal the Makefile and make-macosx-ub.sh
 # trash the rest of the the revision. 


===Modifying the Makefile:===

 # Open up the _Makefile_ from thz-read-only
 # Open up the _Makefile_ from the our HEAD tremulous revision
  * ====From the THZ Makefile:====
   # Scroll down to the area that says 'SETUP AND BUILD -- MAC OS X'
   # Delete everything after the string of number signs to the next string of number signs.
  * ====From the HEAD Makefile:====
   # Scroll down to the area thay says 'SETUP AND BUILD -- MAC OS X'.
   # _Copy/Cut_ everything under the string of number signs to the next string of number signs.
  * ====Back to the THZ Makefile:====
   # Paste the code from the _HEAD Makefile_ where you deleted it from the _THZ Makefile_.
   # Save the _THZ Makefile_.
  * ====Trash the HEAD Makefile ====
 # From the _THZ_ directory replace _make-macosx-ub.sh_ with the one from our _HEAD_ revision.
