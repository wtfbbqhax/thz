#How to update your THZ Client + QVM set

= Updating Your QVM set =

If you use the THZ Client for aimbot compatibility you can also easily update your
QVM files.

 # go to Downloads
 # Download the file THZ-QVMs.zip
 # Unzip the Archive
 # Replace existing vm folder and files with the new folder and files
 # Done


This is in place so that the THZ Client doesn't need to be repackaged each 
time we have a mediocre update.



Happy hacking,
