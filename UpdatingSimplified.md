#How to update your THZ Client + QVM set

# Updating Your QVM set #

If you use the THZ Client for aimbot compatibility you can also easily update your
QVM files.

  1. go to Downloads
  1. Download the file THZ-QVMs.zip
  1. Unzip the Archive
  1. Replace existing vm folder and files with the new folder and files
  1. Done


This is in place so that the THZ Client doesn't need to be repackaged each
time we have a mediocre update.



Happy hacking,
